Experience: The martial arts family has good martial arts talents, but admires Li Bai, Su Shi and other literary and ink celebrities since childhood. Although he has spent more time studying Confucianism and ink, he has no talent for it. The martial arts realm that he has not worked hard has been rising, but the realm of Taoism has not made progress. His father, an old friend of the governor of Hangzhou, once saved Sun Zhizhou's life and fell ill, so Song Ni was also half a famous family member and was carefree from childhood. When she grew up, she wanted to meet the celebrities she admired in person, but her father refused because of his lack of martial arts. At that time, Suni worked hard to practice martial arts with her father. But when the martial arts were enough to go out and wander the Jianghu, it happened that the Hangzhou Incident had to stay and meet the protagonist at this time.
